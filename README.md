# Dyadic interactions in virtual reality: Wizards

In order to provide a basis for investigating how complementary dyadic interactions in virtual reality affect one’s own actions, we adapted and transferred the action representation experiment by Sebanz and colleagues (2003) into an immersive virtual environment. A spatial compatibility RT task is distributed between two participants such that each takes care of one response. The task is conducted in three different conditions, an individual two-choice, an individual go-nogo and the joint go-nogo task. The question addressed by the experiment is whether and how one’s own actions are affected by others’ actions. The goal of the original study was to find support for either of two current theories: The social facilitation theory predicts a general effect of the partner’s presence such that an easy task should increase joint performance compared to individual execution, whereas the group performance of a complex task is impaired (Guerin, 1993). On the contrary, ideomotor theories (e.g. Greenwald, 1970) suggest that others’ actions might become represented and have a specific impact on one’s acting by inducing tendencies to engage in coherent actions themselves. This effect can be observed in mimicry (Chartrand and Bargh, 1999), priming (Wegner and Bargh, 1998) and imitation (Brass, Bekkering, Prinz, 1999).

In the original study, participants responded to photographs on a 2D computer screen, showing a hand pointing either to the left, to the right or straight as an irrelevant stimulus which had to be ignored (see Fig. XY). A ring on the index finger was colored either red or green. In the two-choice condition, participants were instructed to respond to one ring color with a left and to the other with a right button press. In the go-nogo conditions, each participant was instructed to respond to only one of the two colors by pushing a single button. The main color stimulus and the irrelevant stimulus were compatible if the finger also pointed in the direction of the button to be pressed, neutral if the finger pointed straight and incompatible if the finger pointed to the button located on the opposite side.

Our implementation in VR provides the participants with different rooms, each representing one specific condition. After starting the application, the user joins an entrance hall that enables the newcomer to discover the features of VR and its equipment in order to properly execute all tasks afterwards. To get to an experiment, the user interacts with a sign indicating the different experimental settings. Both the individual two-choice and go-nogo task confront the participant with a simple assignment (see Fig. XY), that only requires left or right button clicks on the VR controller as a response to a red or green colored wizard’s hat. The irrelevant stimulus appears in the form of a bright light shining through the doors in front of the participant. It either does not influence (neutral), facilitates (compatible) or falsely cues (incompatible) the participant to execute a certain action. 
By using multiplayer networking features in the joint condition, both participants are able to perceive the other’s movement, including positions of the head and hands. This is possible by using the “Mirror” plugin in Unity, originally designed to create MMORPGs (massive multiplayer online role play games), that sends positional data over the network to the local client to create a clone of the other participant. Thereby, in comparison to the 2D experiment, an ecologically valid environment is created in which the direct perception of the other participant’s responses enable the researcher to properly investigate joint action. Furthermore, the experiment is Harry-Potter-themed, aiming to facilitate users’ immersion into a game-like virtual reality experience in order to enhance their focus as well as motivation in performing the respective tasks. The application then automatically and precisely keeps track of reaction times and saves them in a csv-file. This immersive environment then enables the researcher to analyse whether and how the participant's individual actions were affected by the partner’s actions, testing either of the above stated action representation theories.

To use this application, start the project on two PC's each, both with a VR headset and controllers connected. You also need SteamVR. The current version supports and works properly with the Oculus Rift, though for using other headsets that are supported by SteamVR you only have to re-define the actions via SteamVR Input.
After starting both applications you can individually do experiment 1 and 2. <br>
[!] For joining the (networked) experiment 3, one participant has to join as a host, the other as a client after the host (the order is important!). The client has to use the host's IPv4 adress to join. This IPv4 address should be shown in the corner of the host's screen after joining the experiment. If it does not (due to different screen sizes) find the IPv4 by typing "ipconfig" into the command line of the host (Windows) or search in the system preferences under network settings (Mac). <br>
The results of the experiments are saved in the "results.txt" in Assets/Results.
